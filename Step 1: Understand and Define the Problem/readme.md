Step 1 

To successfully implement a working automatic pet feeder there are requirements to ensure that it is efficient and working, these include: 
Always ensuring that food for animals is dispensed at a certain time to monitor feeding habits 
Implementing a weight scale to monitor how much food has been dispensed 
Alert monitoring system to limit the amount of jams/dispensing issues
Sensors to monitor if it has been eaten or has not. 

Limitations: 
Dry Kibble would be the only option for a pet feeder
Only one bowl per feeder so no sharing between animals to ensure balance. 

Assumptions: 
System should have a real-time clock in order to feed at specific times.
