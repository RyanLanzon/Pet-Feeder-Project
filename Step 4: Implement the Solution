Step 4: Implement The Solution (Word Coding 

Start System 

Load feeding times (e.g 8 AM, 6 PM) 
Set feeding amount from funnel (grams)
Reset bowl weight to 0 
Check funnel amount (how much food is currently in there)
Initiate alert system (red = problem, orange = error, green = operational) 

Start dispensary program 

If it isn't feeding time, wait 1 minute before checking again
If it is feeding time: 
                 -  If bin level is below 15% send alert but keep initiating feeding dispenser 
                 - Check for jams (food not moving or motor may be jammed) 
                                      - If jam is detected stop motor 
                                      - wait 10 minutes
        - If 80% of food has been eaten
                                       - Yes - log as success 
                                        - No - send not eaten log 

Manual Controls 

              - Pause feeding if necessary 
              -  Resume when ready 
      
Other Controls 
Keep a log of results for (7 days)
